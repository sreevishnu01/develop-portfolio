        <p>
          I&apos;m Vishnu, a software developer and full-stack engineer
          passionate about building seamless digital experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expertise spans both front-end and back-end development, allowing
          me to craft web applications that are not only visually appealing but
          also scalable and high-performing. Whether it&apos;s designing sleek
          user interfaces or optimizing backend logic, I thrive on solving
          complex challenges with clean, efficient code.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a self-taught programmer, coding has never been &quot;just a
          job&quot; for meâ€”it&apos;s a continuous journey of learning and
          growth. What started with a simple &quot;Hello World&quot; has evolved
          into a deep passion for developing high-quality applications that make
          an impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          With over 5 years of experience, I specialize in modern web
          technologies, system architecture, and building robust full-stack
          solutions. I enjoy working across the stack, from crafting dynamic
          front-end interfaces to designing scalable back-end systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll find me exploring new tech
          trends, working on side projects, or diving into the endless depths of
          cyberspace.
